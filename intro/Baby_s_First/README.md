# Description

>Reversing means reading code. Read this file, and find the flag!

# Material

>babysfirst.py

# Solution

This channel is very easy and beginner friendly. Just as the description suggests, all we have to do is read the file.

>cat babysfirst.py

Running that command to read the file prints the whole file's content in the terminal. Now if we look at the code closer, we can see that the program is taking user input and comparing it to the flag.

>if input("What's the password? ") == "csawctf{w3_411_star7_5om3wher3}":

# Flag

csawctf{w3_411_star7_5om3wher3}
